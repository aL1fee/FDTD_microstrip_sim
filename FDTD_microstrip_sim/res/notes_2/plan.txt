Plan:

#build a coordinate system
#do a camera
#do ok frame timing
#do simple solidworks-like camera
#memory leaks
#start imgui for the first app GUI




*threading:
	1. Main thread: window creation, event processing, high-level application logic
	2. Rendering Thread: renders the scene using OpenGL
	3. Worker Threads: physics updates, math calculations, asset loading


*place openGL context correctly
*make the scroll pointing to the mouse; not the front vector
*do correct window resizing

*do .frag and .vert shader files rather than .shader

*make custom polygons with defined sizes

*implement a hierarchy data structure to store elements & its properties of a scene




*shaders: https://github.com/benburrill/picoputt/tree/main


*incorporate matrix stack calls when calculating model,view,proj matrices as specified in the book








------
future:
------
* implement elaborate solidworks camera
* use qt to create a comprehensive GUI (like FreeCAD, ParaView ones)
* memory leaks
